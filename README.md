Simple Vending Machine. Implement a FSM of a vending machine that can accept $1 coins and 50Â¢ coins.

Memory Primitives. Instantiate a LUT-based distributed memory.

### How it works:
Certain 8-bit values can be stored in 6-bit user-defined address spaces. 

- Enable save_data to update the reg_d value. 

- Change d_in to either set the input to the flip-flop or to set the 6-bit address for Lab2_mem.

- Enable write_en to write the 8-bit reg_d value into the 6-bit memory address' location.

- To access the stored value in Lab2_mem, set the d_in to the address location, and enable show_reg.
